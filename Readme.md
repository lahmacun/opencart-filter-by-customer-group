Note: I'm not pro in OpenCart so I don't know which versions does this mod supports. So, If you want to contribute, you can check it with different versions of OpenCart and send me a pull request.

##What To Do Next
Maybe we can add Customer Group column in table. I don't think it's necessary but it will be good.
